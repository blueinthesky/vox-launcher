Introduction
============

Vox launcher is a simple speech-to-command program in Python that uses Google's Speech
Recognition facility to convert speech into text and then execute a command, if
appropriate, on the local machine.

Dependencies
============

This program is designed to run on Linux and depends on: 
- python-gtk2(>=2.16)
- python-dbus
- python-alsaaudio(>=0.5)
- python-gobject-2(>=2.16)
- python-simplejson
- pynotify

Tested on Ubuntu 11.04.

Execution
=========

Just run vox-launcher and speak for up to three seconds. The audio will
be then processed and translated and an action may be taken.
When the traffic light is red the program is not ready to listen you;
please wait the green light before speak with the vox launcher.

Examples
========

vox-launcher can be used to launch processes:

    "open firefox"

Command list
============

You can read the default command list handled by vox launcher reading the left column
in your language configuration file (e.g. /etc/vox-launcher/vox_launcher_it.conf).
If the recognized words are not declared in the con file vox launcher will try to launch
the recognized text as is.

Customization
=============

Vox launcher is highly configurable modifying some configuration file located
under the /etc/vox-launcher folder.
In order to customize the vox laucher we must edit the the correspondent language file.
For example to customize the recognition in italian language we can modify the
/etc/vox-launcher/vox_launcher_it.conf file.

The semantic of the conf file is the simplest as possible following the behavioural 
stimulus-response pattern:

[detected word] -> [command to run]

e.g.
browser -> chromium-browser

Voice launcher when will detect the browser world will launch the chromium-browser command.
You can change the default browser from chromium to firefox simply changing the previous line 
into:

browser -> firefox
