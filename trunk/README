Command list
------------

You can read the default command list handled by vox launcher reading the left column
of your language configuration file (e.g. /etc/vox-launcher/vox_launcher_it.conf).
If the recognized words are not declared in the configuration file vox launcher will try 
to launch the recognized text as is.

Customization
-------------

Vox launcher is highly configurable modifying some configuration file located
under the /etc/vox-launcher folder.
In order to customize the vox laucher we must edit the the correspondent language file.
For example to customize the recognition in italian language we can modify the
/etc/vox-launcher/vox_launcher-it_IT.conf file.

The semantic of the conf file is the simplest as possible following the behavioural 
stimulus-response pattern:

[detected word] -> [command to run]

e.g.
browser -> chromium-browser

Voice launcher when will detect the browser world will launch the chromium-browser command.
You can change the default browser from chromium to firefox simply changing the previous line 
into:

browser -> firefox
