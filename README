/etc/vox-launcher/vox_launcher-it_IT.conf file.

The semantic of the conf file is the simplest as possible following the behavioural 
stimulus-response pattern:

[detected word] -> [command to run]

e.g.
browser -> chromium-browser

Voice launcher when will detect the browser world will launch the chromium-browser command.
You can change the default browser from chromium to firefox simply changing the previous line 
into:

browser -> firefox
